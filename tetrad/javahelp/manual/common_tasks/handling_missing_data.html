<p>Missing coltData is represented in both the tabular and covariance coltData editors by an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;). There are three ways to create missing coltData values in a coltData set:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the Data Editor, replace the relevant entries with asterisks, by hand.</li>
  <li>When loading coltData, load coltData that contains missing values.</li>
  <li>From the Tools menu in the Data Editor, select &quot;Inject Missing Values Randomly.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The first way explicitly declares that a particular datum is missing. The second way  reflects missing coltData as represented in a coltData file. The third way automatically adds missing coltData at random in a coltData file, usually as a test of how an algorithm performs under conditions of missing coltData.</p>
<p>Usually it is a good idea to remove or impute missing coltData before handing it over to an algorithm. With tabular coltData, one has the option of removing cases containing missing values from a coltData file, by selecting Tools--&gt;Missing Values--&gt;Remove Cases with Missing Values. Selecting instead Tools--&gt;MissingValues--&gt;Replace Missing Values with Column Mode will replace missing values with the mode of the column. This will work for either continuous or discrete coltData. Similarly for Tools--&gt;MissingValues--&gt;Replace Missing Values with Column Mean, although this operates only on continuous columns. Also, Tools-&gt;Missing values--&gt;Replace Missing Values with Extra Category works on discrete variables only and addes an extra category to each indicating where the missing values were.</p>
<p>Tools--&gt;Missing values--&gt;Replace Missing Values with Regression Predictions imputes missing values using a regression model, as follows. First, in a copy of the coltData set, missing values are imputed using means. Then for each missing value, the column of that missing value is regressed onto the remaining columns in the coltData set, and the predicted value for the case of the missing value using values from the coltData set copy replaces the missing value. </p>
<p>If an algorithm is handed coltData with missing values and does not have a means to deal with it sensibly, a message is posted asking the use to remove or impute the missing coltData first. Some algorithm configurations do have sensible means to deal with missing coltData, in which case the coltData is used. For instance, any algorithm taking a Chi Square or G Square independence test as oracle can sensibly ignore rows of variables being compared that contain missing values. For fine control over handling of missing coltData, it is best, however, to impute missing coltData first.</p>
<p>Algorithms that can handle missing coltData include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any search algorithm using Chi Square or G Square as an conditional independence oracle.</li>
  <li>ML Bayes Updater</li>
  <li>Dirichlet Bayes updater</li>
  <li>EM Bayes Updater   </li>
</ul>
<p>Any other algorithm that takes coltData as an input will display an error message if the coltData contains missing values. </p>
