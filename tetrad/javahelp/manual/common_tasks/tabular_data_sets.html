<p>A tabular coltData set is a rectangular coltData set consisting of a certain number of rows (or cases) of coltData for a certain list of continuous and/or discrete variables. For information on variables in Tetrad, see <a href="continuous_and_discrete_variables.html">Continuous and Discrete Variables</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>rectangular coltData set</em> is one in which all column lengths are equal. A <em>continuous coltData set</em> is a tabular coltData set consisting entirely of coltData for continuous variables. A <em>discrete coltData set</em> is a tabular coltData set consisting entirely of coltData for discrete variables. A <em>mixed coltData set</em> is a tabular coltData set consisting of coltData partially for continuous variables and partially for discrete variables. </p>
<p>All search, estimation, and update procedures in Tetrad require that tabular coltData they use be rectangular, so the basic representation of a tabular coltData set requires this as well. If you add coltData to a column in a tabular coltData set, moving some of the coltData in that column down, columns of missing values will be added to other columns to ensure that the coltData set as a whole remains rectangular.</p>
<p>Also, all of the search, estimation, and update procedures in Tetrad require coltData that is either entirely discrete or entirely continuous, although in this case Tetrad allows for mixed coltData sets to be represented. Tools are available to convert mixed coltData sets into coltData sets that are either continuous or discrete. See <a href="../../common_tasks/discretizing_data.html">Discretizing Data</a> and <a href="../../common_tasks/editing_tabular_data.html">Editing Tabular Data</a> for more details</p>
