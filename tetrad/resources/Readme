IMPORTANT!

These files in this directory are used by Tetrad in the process of publishing
new versions:

copyright
license
version

The 'copyright' file contains a message that will appear to users when they
start Tetrad. The 'license' file contains the text of the GNU GPL license,
as posted at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt.

The 'version' file contains the version number of the most recently
published version of Tetrad. It is updated automatically each time the Ant
upload task is executed.

The 'version' file normally contains a string of this form as
its first line:

    a.b.c-d

where a is the major version, b the minor version, c the
minor subversion, and d the incremental release. For example:

    4.3.1-5

If it contains a string of this form, then the next time
the upload task is called, the incremental release will be
updated--e.g.:

    4.3.1-6

If some other version number should be updated, the string
after that version number should be deleted. For instance,
if the major version should be updated, the string should
be modified to this:

    4

and at next upload this will become:

    5.0.0-0

and similarly if the minor version should be updated, the
string should be truncated to this:

    4.3

and on upload this will become:

    4.4.0-0

and if the minor subversion should be updated, the string
should be truncated to this:

    4.3.1

and on update this will become:

    4.3.2-0

No other string types are permitted; anything else will cause
the upload task to fail.
