This file lists notable changes to Tetrad IV since version 4.10-5.

4.3.10-6

* Fixed a bug in the PC adjacency search. Sometimes X _||_ Y | X was performed.
* Fixed a bug preventing LOFS from launching on arbitrary machines.
* Fixed the distribution (some references/jars were out of place).
* Moved the code for pal.math.ConjugateDirectionSearch (kindly provided) inside of Tetrad to eliminate a System.exit()
call. This seems to have improved the performance of the algorithm.
* Fixed a bug in the ConjugateDirectionSearch in the PAL library. Some parameters were being ignored
in estimation. Affects PAL CDS SEM estimator.
* Fixed bug in adjacency search for PC, FCI, etc. Forbidding knowledge both ways was not removing
the edge.

4.3.10-7

* Added a separate field to the HBSMS editor to allow zero edges to removed with an alpha
level separate from that of the search itself.
* For simulating from a covariance matrix, allowed the simulation to go through even if NaN or Infinity was produced,
in order to aid debugging of the covariance matrix.
* Took out code in HBSMS that was converting covariance matrices to random simulated coltData sets and passed
covariance matrices directly into HBSMS.
* Switch the adjacency search in PcPattern to Fas5, the same as the other searches that use the same adjacency search
step.
* Added three multi-dataset continuous independence tests to the interface: Fisher, Tippett, and Fisher Z with
pooled residuals.
* Added an exception (and error message) to IMaGES in case a residual of zero is detected, learing to an
infinite BIC score. The error message points the user to the coltData set in which the multicollinearity
occurs.
* Fixed bug in PurifyTetradBasedD, in which cross clusters containing common children listed variables multiple times.
* Fixed unit tests so they all pass.
* Added a gadget to remove selected variables from a coltData set to coltData manip.
* Added MIM random graph generator to graph initializer.
* Added a graph manipulation to extract the structure graph (i.e. the graph over the latents) from a given graph.
* If you add a Data box as output from a Mimbuild box you will get the estimated covariance matrix that Mimbuild
uses as input to the pattern search, in case you want to try your own pattern search instead.
* Added the latent reidentification algorithm from Silva et al (JMLR) to BPC, fixed several linkage problems so
that the output of BPC/Mimbuild can be compared to the pattern of the generating Multiple Indicator Model (MIM).
* Added logging of tetrads for BPC and Purify.
* Fixed a problem in the PC adjacency search where for unfaithful distributions it would give different answers on
differnet runs. Had to do with the order in which adjacent nodes to a node; this is now fixed.
* Added FOFC (Find One Factor Clusters) to the BPC interface.
* Fixed bug in GeneralizedSemPm to allow it to initialize models as linear, Gaussian.
* Fixed layout issue that was arranging latents in a line when BPC was run.
* Added logging of sextad values.
* Added PC Adjacency Search ("fast" adjacency search, FAS) to the interface. Produces and undirected
graph.
* Added the Identifiability Bayes IM Updater to the interface.
* Modified IMaGES so that when nodes have more than 10 (relevant) neighbors in the course of search,
random subsets are selected from the powerset of these nodes. Allows searches over denser graphs.
* Adjusted the stopping condition of PC to the condition in Causation, Prediction and Search.

4.3.10-8
* Changed from ProbUtils.chisqcdf to Probability.chisquare because of a blind spot in the former function for chisq = 0,
df = 2. This was evaluating to NaN instead of to 0.
* Fixed a problem with SEM Estimator Editor in which scrolling was out of control.
* Added RICF (Recursive Iterative Conditional Fitting) as an estimation option in the SEM Estimator.
* Fixed the EM estimator.
* Improved the Random and CDF estimators.
* Fixed consistency of model choice with parents, editor of intercepts saying "Intercepts" instead of "Mean."
* Overrode ObjectInputStream in the session loader to use local UID's, to fix a problem in which the Java source code
messed up serialization for one of its classes.
* Fixed a bug in the conditional discrete histogram; it wasn't always matching variable values to variables.

5.0.0.3
* Fixed a bug in CCD in which the initial adjacency search was outputting --- graphs instead of o-o
graphs.

5.0.0.4
* Fixed SEM Estimator so it remembers which optimizer you're using after you delete and recreate the estimator.
* Optimized GES so that it can scale up to thousands of variables now with reasonable accuracy and speed for
continuous variables. (Still a bit slow for very large models.)
* Fixed standard error estimation in Sem Estiamtor for a corner case in which second derivatives could not be
calculated.
* Adjusted scoring procedure in GES and IMaGES to correct some minor bugs.

5.0.0.5
* Fixed a bug in SEM IM where information was not being displayed for all error terms.
* More cleanup/optimizatiom of GES and IMaGES.
* In the Paths action, added a field to bound the length of the paths found.
* New feature to compare independence tests from multiple sources.

5.0.0.6
* Not different in any substantial way, except that it's signed with a legitimate cert (not self-signed).

5.0.0.7
* Fixed a bug in IMaGES; the clause allowing missing variables in data sets was missing.
* New scatterplot gadget. Debugged, allows conditioning on variables.
